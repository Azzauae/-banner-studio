## 🎯 About Me

Experienced Product Manager with a proven track record of building products that solve real user problems and deliver measurable business impact. I combine strategic thinking with technical understanding to bridge the gap between business goals and user needs.

**My Philosophy**: Great products solve real problems. Great Product Managers understand those problems deeply—not just the symptoms, but the root causes. Then we design solutions that are not just functional, but delightful.

## 🚀 Featured Project

### [Banner Studio: Marketing Automation Platform](./projects/banner-studio/README.md)

**The Challenge**: Marketing teams spent 12-16 hours manually creating banners for social media campaigns, leading to delayed launches, inconsistent quality, and team frustration.

**My Approach**: 
- Conducted user research to understand workflow pain points
- Designed batch-processing solution with intelligent automation
- Led development focusing on fault tolerance and user experience
- Iterated based on real-world usage and feedback

**The Solution**: Intelligent banner generation system that automates the entire workflow—from image processing to multi-platform export—with smart defaults and graceful error handling.

**Business Impact**:
- ⏱️ **95% time reduction** (16 hours → 5 minutes for 50 banners)
- 📈 **10x scalability** - handles campaigns of any size without linear time increase
- ✅ **100% quality consistency** - eliminates human error in typography and positioning
- 🚀 **Faster time-to-market** - campaigns launch days earlier

## 🏗️ My Product Approach

### 1. Problem-First Thinking
Always start with the problem, not the solution. I believe in understanding user pain points deeply—not just what they say they need, but why they need it.

**Example**: Banner Studio started not with "let's build a banner generator," but with understanding the frustration of spending 16 hours on repetitive manual work.

### 2. Data-Informed Decisions
Metrics and user feedback guide every decision. I balance quantitative data (time saved, error rates, adoption) with qualitative insights (user interviews, feedback).

**Tools**: Analytics, user interviews, A/B testing, usage patterns

### 3. Strategic Prioritization
Every feature is evaluated through the lens of:
- **Business Impact**: Does it drive key metrics?
- **User Value**: Does it solve a real problem?
- **Technical Feasibility**: Can we build it well and maintain it?
- **Strategic Alignment**: Does it move us toward our vision?

### 4. Execution Excellence
Building products is about more than ideas—it's about shipping value. I focus on:
- Iterative delivery with quick feedback loops
- Clear documentation and communication
- Measurable outcomes, not just outputs
